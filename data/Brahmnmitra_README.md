# Brahmnmitra — Website & Travel Platform

**Project:** Brahmnmitra  
**Current package:** Existing static travel-agency website + PHP enquiry backend  
**Planned direction:** Premium travel website → customer travel platform → CRM → loyalty → AI → finance

---

## 1. Project Overview

Brahmnmitra is a premium travel-agency website focused on:

- Domestic travel
- International travel
- Tours
- Tailor-made journeys
- Luxury travel
- Heritage tours
- MICE & corporate travel
- Ground transportation
- Domestic flights
- International flights

The **current project is intentionally lightweight** and can be deployed directly to shared hosting such as Hostinger. It currently has:

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- Three.js + GSAP cinematic airplane intro
- PHP enquiry backend
- PHPMailer
- Optional SMTP
- Server-side validation
- Enquiry logging
- Log rotation
- Security headers / CSP
- Branded 404/500 pages
- Responsive design
- Accessibility / reduced-motion fallback

The long-term goal is to evolve Brahmnmitra into:

> **A premium travel brand on the outside + a complete travel-management platform on the inside.**

## Frontend surfaces

- **Public traveller frontend:** `index.html` with dedicated package, hotel,
  destination, travel-assistant and customer-account pages. Visitors can search
  and filter the catalogue, save ideas, create a planning draft and retain
  browser-local preferences and activity.
- **Operations frontend:** `admin.html` for leads, catalogue, bookings and
  payment workflow. Staff can add/update leads, create local planning records,
  and export or restore a browser-local backup. It must be connected to
  authenticated `/backend` APIs before it is used for real customer data.

## Current feature status

The static release now includes practical, browser-local workflows in addition
to the protected PHP enquiry endpoint:

| Area               | Available now                                                                                 | Production requirement before using customer data                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Catalogue          | Package, hotel and destination search, filters, sort, starting-price cards and saved ideas    | Database catalogue, supplier integrations and live availability           |
| Trip planning      | Custom travellers, budget, planning preferences, itinerary-draft generator and quote hand-off | Authenticated saved plans and expert/API itinerary service                |
| Customer workspace | Local preferences, saved ideas, planning drafts, recent activity and planning-point display   | Authentication, encrypted storage, bookings, payments and document access |
| Staff workspace    | Leads, pipeline status, catalogue drafts, bookings, payment records and JSON backup/restore   | Staff authentication, roles, CSRF protection, audit logs and a database   |
| Enquiries          | Validated PHP form, optional email delivery, protected log and WhatsApp fallback              | CRM ingestion, consent records and staff assignment                       |

### Browser-local data notice

`assets/js/platform-store.js` and `assets/js/admin.js` use `localStorage` for
the prototype workflows. Data stays on the current device/browser and can be
lost if browser storage is cleared. Do not enter passport data, card data,
government IDs or other sensitive customer information in the static account or
admin workspace.

# 3. IMPORTANT: PRESERVE THE EXISTING WEBSITE

The current visual website should **not** be blindly rewritten.

Before implementing the new platform:

1. Inspect the complete existing project.
2. Understand the current HTML/CSS/JS architecture.
3. Identify reusable components and logic.
4. Preserve the Brahmnmitra visual identity.
5. Preserve working enquiry functionality.
6. Preserve security measures.
7. Preserve responsive behaviour.
8. Preserve accessibility and reduced-motion fallbacks.
9. Preserve existing assets unless replacement is intentional.
10. Refactor only where necessary.

The new system should be an evolution of the existing project, not an unrelated redesign.

---

# 4. CURRENT DEPLOYMENT MODEL

The current package is designed for direct shared-hosting deployment.

### Current setup

- No build step
- No Node.js requirement
- No Docker requirement
- PHP backend
- Hostinger-compatible
- `index.html` at public root

### Current production flow

```text
Visitor
   ↓
index.html
   ↓
Enquiry form
   ↓
backend/enquiry.php
   ↓
helpers.php
   ↓
backend/logs/enquiries.log
   ↓
mailer.php / PHPMailer
   ↓
Email
```

This should continue working while the new architecture is being developed.

---

# 5. EXISTING ENQUIRY SYSTEM

The existing enquiry system should be retained until the new CRM/booking system replaces it.

## Current protections

- Server-side validation
- Client-side validation
- Header-injection protection
- Email validation
- Phone validation
- Date validation
- Service whitelist
- Rate limiting
- Enquiry logging
- Log rotation
- JSON response support
- No-JavaScript fallback
- WhatsApp fallback

### Important

`backend/logs/enquiries.log` contains customer information.

Do not remove:

```text
backend/logs/.htaccess
```

Do not expose the log through a public route.

---

# 6. EXISTING EMAIL CONFIGURATION

The primary configuration file is:

```text
backend/includes/config.php
```

Current important settings include:

```php
define('TO_EMAIL', 'info@brahmnmitra.com');
define('FROM_EMAIL', 'enquiry@brahmnmitra.com');
define('FROM_NAME', 'BrahmnMitra');
```

Optional SMTP settings are also available.

**Never commit real SMTP passwords or other secrets to Git.**

Use environment variables / secure server configuration when the project is migrated to a backend architecture.

---

# 7. EXISTING AIRPLANE EXPERIENCE

The cinematic airplane intro is implemented primarily through:

```text
assets/js/main.js
assets/css/animations.css
```

The current experience uses:

- Three.js
- GSAP
- ScrollTrigger
- Smooth interpolation
- Flight-path keyframes
- Camera movement
- Plane rotation/banking
- WebGL fallback
- Reduced-motion fallback

## Planned improvement

### Smoothen the airplane animation

The current airplane movement should be made significantly smoother.

Do not solve this by simply adding random easing.

Review:

- Scroll-to-progress mapping
- Position interpolation
- Rotation interpolation
- Banking
- Camera interpolation
- Acceleration/deceleration
- Flight path
- RAF loop
- Frame-rate independence
- Mobile rendering
- DPR
- Reduced-motion behaviour

The airplane should feel cinematic and physically smooth.

Avoid:

- Jitter
- Snapping
- Sudden banking
- Turbulence-like movement
- Abrupt acceleration
- Camera/plane desynchronisation

---

# 8. CURRENT CONTENT ITEMS TO VERIFY

Before public launch, verify all statistics and testimonials currently present in the existing website.

Current statistics include values such as:

- 500+ Happy Clients
- 50+ Destinations
- 24/7 On-Ground Support
- 10+ Years of Experience
- 500+ Happy Corporate Clients
- 50,000+ Trips Managed
- 98% Client Retention

These must represent real, supportable figures.

Likewise, verify the existing testimonials and company/person names before publishing.

Do not publish fabricated testimonials or unsupported statistics.

# 33. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE — TARGET STATE

The current static site is suitable for the initial public website, but the complete platform should eventually move toward a scalable architecture.

Recommended target:

```text
                    BRAHMNMITRA
                         │
          ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
          │                             │
      Public Website                Admin Panel
          │                             │
          └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                         │
                      Backend
                         │
        ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
        │                │                │
    PostgreSQL         Redis           Storage
        │                                 │
        └──────────────┬──────────────────┘
                       │
                External Services
                       │
       ┌───────────────┼─────────────────┐
       │               │                 │
    Payments        WhatsApp          Email
       │
    AI / APIs
```

Possible stack:

### Frontend

Next.js + React + TypeScript

### Backend

Node.js / Express / NestJS

or FastAPI if Python is preferred.

### Database

PostgreSQL

### Cache

Redis

### Storage

AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2 or equivalent

### Authentication

Secure authentication + role-based authorization

The existing site does **not** need to be migrated all at once.

---

# 34. DATABASE TARGET STRUCTURE

Design the database before implementing the full feature set.

Core entities:

```text
users
profiles
roles
permissions

destinations
packages
package_days
package_activities

hotels
hotel_rooms
hotel_amenities

bookings
booking_items
travellers
payments
refunds

leads
lead_notes
followups
quotations
quotation_items

reviews
ratings

loyalty_accounts
loyalty_transactions
referrals

search_history
travel_history
recommendations

suppliers
supplier_transactions

expenses
incomes
invoices

notifications
documents

audit_logs
```

Important:

**One customer should have one customer record shared across the platform.**

Do not create separate customer records for CRM, bookings, loyalty and reviews.

---

# 35. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

The future platform will eventually handle:

- Customer information
- Payments
- Travel documents
- Passport/visa information
- Staff accounts
- Financial information

Therefore implement:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Role-based access
- Input validation
- Secure password hashing
- Rate limiting
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection where applicable
- Secure API design
- Audit logs
- Protected admin routes
- Secure file storage
- Environment variables
- Secret management
- Secure payment handling

Never commit:

- API keys
- SMTP passwords
- Database passwords
- JWT secrets
- Payment credentials
- Other production secrets

---

# 36. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

The website must remain fast even as features are added.

Optimize:

- Images
- Three.js
- JavaScript bundles
- Fonts
- API requests
- Database queries
- Lazy loading
- Code splitting
- Caching
- Mobile rendering

The cinematic identity should remain intact without allowing animations to destroy performance.

---

# 37. RESPONSIVE DESIGN

All customer-facing and administrative features must work on:

- Desktop
- Laptop
- Tablet
- Mobile

Pay particular attention to:

- Airplane animation
- Navigation
- Package cards
- Hotel cards
- Search
- Forms
- AI assistant
- Customer dashboard
- CRM
- Tables
- Charts

---

# 38. ADMIN DASHBOARD

Create a professional Brahmnmitra Admin Dashboard.

Overview:

```text
Today's Enquiries
Pending Follow-ups
Confirmed Bookings
Pending Payments
Refund Requests
Today's Revenue
Monthly Revenue
```

Analytics:

- Revenue
- Bookings
- Leads
- Conversion rate
- Expenses
- Profit/Loss
- Popular destinations
- Package performance

---

# 39. ANALYTICS

Track:

- Website visitors
- Search behaviour
- Most viewed destinations
- Most viewed packages
- Enquiries
- Conversion rate
- Bookings
- Average booking value
- Customer acquisition source
- Repeat customers
- Popular destinations
- Cancellation rate
- Refund rate

This data should eventually improve the recommendation engine.

# 41. DEVELOPMENT RULES FOR AI / CODING AGENTS

When another AI coding agent works on this repository:

### First

Inspect the entire repository.

### Then

Create a short implementation plan.

### Then

Implement only the requested phase.

### Never

- Delete existing functionality without reason
- Replace the design with a generic template
- Remove security headers casually
- Remove enquiry logging
- Expose logs
- Commit secrets
- Hardcode credentials
- Fake customer data
- Fake reviews
- Invent visa requirements
- Add unnecessary dependencies
- Rewrite the whole application when a focused change is enough

### After each major change

Check:

- Desktop
- Mobile
- JavaScript disabled
- Reduced motion
- WebGL unavailable
- Form submission
- Error handling
- Console errors
- Network errors
- Security headers

---

# 42. DEFINITION OF DONE

## 46. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PLANS - 22-POINT PLATFORM ROADMAP

The following items capture the supplied product-development brief. They are **future plans**, not claims about functionality that is currently available.

1. **Customer-facing travel platform** - evolve the marketing website into a transactional journey-planning experience.
2. **Domestic and international packages** - build searchable, database-driven package catalogues with itinerary, inclusions, availability, reviews and enquiry/booking flows.
3. **Hotels module** - add curated hotel listings, filters and a design that can later connect to live inventory APIs.
4. **Brahmnmitra Travel Assistant** - centralise AI-assisted visa, destination-planning and weather-planning tools.
5. **Recent searches** - retain recent destinations, packages and hotels for both signed-in and anonymous visitors.
6. **Travel-history recommendations** - suggest relevant destinations using search, travel and booking history.
7. **Also-visited recommendations** - start with curated relationships and progressively use behavioural and booking data.
8. **Brahmnmitra Account and Rewards** - provide trips, bookings, saved items, documents, payments, referrals, points and membership tiers.
9. **Ratings and verified reviews** - allow protected public ratings and reservation-verified traveller reviews.
10. **Booking and cancellation journeys** - cover quotation, payment, confirmation, documents, trip completion, cancellation and refunds.
11. **Brahmnmitra Admin / CRM** - provide a protected, role-based workspace for leads, customers, notes, follow-ups and operations.
12. **Quotation builder** - enable staff to create, price, send, track and convert quotations into bookings.
13. **Payments** - support advance, partial and final payment tracking with invoices and payment statuses.
14. **Finance layer** - add reporting for income, expenses, receivables, payables, commissions, refunds and profit/loss; integrate with accounting software where appropriate.
15. **Supplier and vendor management** - manage hotels, transport, airlines, operators, visa agents, activity providers and guides.
16. **Staff and permissions** - implement configurable roles for super admins, managers, sales, operations, accounts and content staff.
17. **Notifications** - create customer and staff notifications, with future email, WhatsApp, SMS and push channels.
18. **Travel document vault** - securely provide tickets, vouchers, invoices, insurance, visas, itineraries and receipts.
19. **Global search** - search destinations, packages, hotels, activities, travel guides, blogs and FAQs from one interface.
20. **SEO-friendly destination pages and Travel Journal** - publish destination hubs, guides, travel tips and reviewed factual content.
21. **Homepage conversion flow and airplane animation** - centre the homepage on trip planning and refine the existing Three.js/GSAP flight into one smooth, frame-rate-independent animation loop.
22. **Scalable technical foundation and phased delivery** - plan the public site, admin panel, backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, secure object storage, integrations and database design before extending the platform in controlled phases.
