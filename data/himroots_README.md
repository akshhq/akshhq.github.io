## Architecture & E-Commerce Integration Overview

This platform is structured for a lean, production-grade e-commerce model where the frontend delivers an ultra-fast, premium client-side shopping experience, backed by a serverless/cloud backend for payment security, data persistence, and manual fulfillment workflows.

### 1. Current Architecture
* **Client-Side SPA:** Built using **React 19, TypeScript, and Vite 8**.
* **Zero Legacy Server Overhead:** The entire frontend is rendered client-side with lightning-fast route transitions via React Router v7.
* **Decoupled State Management:** Cart items and single-logo visibility states are managed independently via Zustand stores, with cart persistence backed by browser `localStorage`.

### 2. Existing Frontend
* **Fully Built & Production-Styled:** Includes all user-facing landing, storytelling, catalog, product details, cart, checkout, success, and contact views.
* **Component Reusability:** Every page is composed of modular layout and UI primitives (`RootLayout`, `Navbar`, `Footer`, `BrandLogo`, `Button`, `InstagramIcon`) following Tailwind CSS v4 design tokens.
* **Static Product Layer:** The catalog currently references a typed in-memory array (`src/data/products.ts`) containing full nutritional, percentage, pricing, and packaging metadata for both flagship products.

### 3. Backend / API Architecture (Node.js + Express)
* **Dedicated Trusted Execution Layer:** A secure, modular **Node.js + Express** server located in [`server/`](file:///d:/Clg/Client%20Work/HimRoots/server):
  * Entrypoint: [`server/index.ts`](file:///d:/Clg/Client%20Work/HimRoots/server/index.ts)
  * Port: `5000` (development default, proxied seamlessly by Vite via [`vite.config.ts`](file:///d:/Clg/Client%20Work/HimRoots/vite.config.ts)).
  * Secret Protection: Strict segregation of client variables (`VITE_*`) from private server secrets (`RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`).
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  1. **Product Retrieval:** Serves verified catalog items via `/api/products` (Supabase query with fallback to static catalog).
  2. **Order Validation & Price Verification:** Recomputes product line totals from database values, computes subtotals, applies zero shipping fee (complimentary shipping across India), and generates a human-readable order number (`HM-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`).
  3. **Razorpay Payment Preparation:** Creates official Razorpay order instances in paise via Razorpay Node SDK.
  4. **Payment Signature Verification:** Cryptographically verifies incoming `razorpay_signature` using HMAC SHA256 before updating order status to `paid`.
  5. **Contact Inquiries:** Persists form submissions directly to the `contact_inquiries` table.
* **API Endpoints:**
  * `GET /api/health` — Integration status check (Supabase & Razorpay connection states).
  * `GET /api/products` — Retrieve all active products.
  * `GET /api/products/:identifier` — Retrieve single product by slug or ID.
  * `POST /api/orders/create` — Validates cart items, verifies prices, creates Razorpay order, persists order to Supabase.
  * `POST /api/orders/verify` — Validates HMAC SHA256 payment signature and marks order as paid.
  * `GET /api/orders/:identifier` — Safe order receipt lookup for the order-success screen.
  * `POST /api/contact` — Receives and stores customer inquiries.

### 4. Database Layer (Supabase PostgreSQL)
* **Storage Engine:** Managed PostgreSQL on [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (recommended region: South Asia / Mumbai `ap-south-1`).
* **Migration & Seed Files:**
  * Schema Migration: [`supabase/schema.sql`](file:///d:/Clg/Client%20Work/HimRoots/supabase/schema.sql)
  * Catalog Seed Data: [`supabase/seed.sql`](file:///d:/Clg/Client%20Work/HimRoots/supabase/seed.sql)
  * TypeScript Types: [`src/types/database.types.ts`](file:///d:/Clg/Client%20Work/HimRoots/src/types/database.types.ts)
  * Supabase Client Helper: [`src/lib/supabase.ts`](file:///d:/Clg/Client%20Work/HimRoots/src/lib/supabase.ts) (with static fallback)
* **Core Schemas:**
  1. **`products`**:
     * Fields: `id`, `name`, `slug`, `tagline`, `script_quote`, `description`, `price`, `original_price`, `volume`, `images`, `category`, `ingredients`, `detailed_ingredients` (JSONB), `benefits`, `certifications`, `directions`, `packaging_feature`, `stock_status` (`in_stock`, `low_stock`, `out_of_stock`), `stock_quantity`, `rating`, `reviews_count`, `is_featured`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
     * Seeded with Himroots' 2 flagship formulations.
  2. **`orders`**:
     * Fields: `id` (UUID), `order_number` (Unique human-readable, e.g. `HM-20260924-0001`), `customer_name`, `email`, `phone`, `shipping_address`, `city`, `state`, `pincode`, `country` (India), `subtotal`, `shipping_fee`, `discount`, `total`, `payment_status` (`pending`, `paid`, `failed`, `refunded`), `order_status` (`received`, `processing`, `packed`, `shipped`, `delivered`, `cancelled`), `razorpay_order_id`, `razorpay_payment_id`, `notes`, `paid_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
  3. **`order_items`**:
     * Fields: `id` (UUID), `order_id` (FK -> `orders.id` ON DELETE CASCADE), `product_id` (FK -> `products.id`), `product_name` (immutable name snapshot), `quantity`, `price` (immutable price snapshot), `subtotal`, `created_at`.
  4. **`contact_inquiries`**:
     * Fields: `id` (UUID), `name`, `email`, `phone`, `subject`, `message`, `status` (`unread`, `read`, `responded`, `archived`), `created_at`.
* **Human-Readable Order Number Generator:**
  * Implemented via a PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL function `public.generate_order_number()`.
  * Generates format `HM-YYYYMMDD-XXXX` based on current UTC date and daily sequence.
* **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:**
  * `products`: Public can read (`SELECT USING (true)`). Mutations restricted strictly to `service_role`.
  * `orders`: Public read and write are completely denied (`USING (false)`). Strictly managed server-side via `service_role`. Customers cannot read other orders or tamper with payment states.
  * `order_items`: Direct public read/write denied. Access restricted to `service_role`.
  * `contact_inquiries`: Public can insert new inquiries (`WITH CHECK (true)`). Reading or modifying messages is restricted to `service_role`.
* **Manual Setup Steps:**
  1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
  2. Open the **SQL Editor** tab.
  3. Paste the contents of `supabase/schema.sql` and run.
  4. Paste the contents of `supabase/seed.sql` and run.
  5. Copy the Project URL, Anon Key, and Service Role Key into your `.env` configuration.

### 5. Payment System (Planned: Razorpay)
* **Gateway:** **Razorpay Standard Checkout** (INR / Indian Rupee transactions).
* **Payment Methods:** Full coverage of UPI (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm), Credit & Debit Cards (RuPay, Visa, Mastercard), and NetBanking.
* **Execution Flow:**
  1. Customer reviews cart and completes shipping details at `/checkout`.
  2. Frontend requests an official Razorpay Order ID from backend (`POST /api/create-order`).
  3. Razorpay modal opens with pre-filled customer details and exact order amount in paise.
  4. Upon successful user authorization, frontend submits the payment ID, order ID, and signature to backend (`POST /api/verify-payment`).
  5. Backend cryptographically verifies the signature, stores the order in Supabase, triggers the fulfillment email, and directs the user to `/order-success`.

### 6. Email System (Planned: Resend or Brevo)
* **Transactional Email Service:** Integration with **Resend** (or Brevo) for guaranteed deliverability.
* **Business Workflow Integration:**
  * Since Himroots manually manages packaging, logistics, and shipping, **the client is sent an immediate, rich HTML notification email upon every completed payment**.
  * Email contents include: Order ID, Customer Name, Mobile Number, Delivery Address, Itemized Products & Quantities, and Total Paid.
  * Contact form queries submitted on `/contact` are simultaneously stored in the database and dispatched to the customer support inbox.

### 7. Required Client Accounts
* **Supabase:** Managed database and serverless backend.
* **Razorpay:** Merchant payment gateway (with completed KYC for live settlements).
* **Resend or Brevo:** API key and verified sending domain for transactional order alerts.
* **Repository Access:** GitHub repository access for automated deployment pipelines.
*(Note: Domain and website hosting are already managed by the client).*

## Key Features & Architecture

### 1. Single Dynamic Logo Presentation
Per brand requirements, the website **never displays the logo twice simultaneously**:
* **Home Page Hero Section:** The primary logo emblem is centered prominently in the hero section with a warm botanical aura.
* **Sticky Navbar:** Using an `IntersectionObserver` paired with Zustand (`src/store/logoStore.ts`), the top navigation logo remains hidden while the hero logo is on screen. The moment the user scrolls past the hero emblem, the navbar logo smoothly animates into view.
* **Internal Pages:** Automatically reveals the navbar logo on all secondary pages (`/shop`, `/products/:slug`, `/about-sea-buckthorn`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/cart`).

### 2. Comprehensive Mobile & Desktop Responsiveness
* Optimized for mobile devices (390px, 412px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px+).
* Zero dead whitespace above the hero (tightened < 1cm / 12–16px vertical gap between sticky navbar and emblem).
* Slide-out mobile navigation drawer with active route indicators and quick links to Instagram.
* Responsive product gallery with smooth thumbnail scrolling and touch-friendly controls.

### 3. Full-Featured Product Discovery & Detail Pages
* **Product Catalog (`/shop`):** Real-time text search, category filters (*All*, *Liquid Elixirs*, *Omega Softgels*), price strike-throughs, and free shipping assurances.
* **Product Details (`/products/:slug`):**
  * Dynamic routing backed by [`src/data/products.ts`](file:///d:/Clg/Client%20Work/HimRoots/src/data/products.ts).
  * High-resolution image gallery with thumbnail selectors.
  * Direct breadcrumb and featured callout links to the botanical guide.
  * Tabbed information layout:
    1. *Key Ingredients & Ratios* (with exact formulation breakdown and guide callout).
    2. *Targeted Wellness Outcomes* (verified benefit points).
    3. *Directions & Recommended Dosage* (numbered step-by-step usage guide).
    4. *Eco-Luxury Canister Construction* (details on UV protection and golden foil stamping).

### 4. Persistent Shopping Cart & Checkout Flow
* State managed via **Zustand** with `persist` middleware (data saved in browser `localStorage`).
* Slide-over cart preview and full `/cart` page with quantity counters, unit prices, subtotal calculations, and item removal.
* Simulated `/checkout` flow with address inputs, payment selection (Card, UPI, NetBanking, COD), order summary, and Razorpay-ready integration structure.

### 5. Official Social Integration
* Consistent usage of the official Instagram asset (`/images/instagram.png`) wrapped in a reusable [`InstagramIcon`](file:///d:/Clg/Client%20Work/HimRoots/src/components/ui/InstagramIcon.tsx) component.
* Integrated across the desktop navbar, mobile drawer, footer, contact channel cards, and narrative community banners linking to `https://www.instagram.com/himroots.wellness/`.

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js:** v18.0.0 or higher
* **npm:** v9.0.0 or higher

### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. In the project root directory, install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Prepare the environment variables file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Running the Development Environment
You can run both frontend and backend concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev:all
```
Or start them individually in separate terminals:
* **Backend API Server (Port 5000):**
  ```bash
  npm run server
  ```
  *(or `npm run server:dev` for auto-reloading watch mode)*
* **Frontend Vite Dev Server (Port 5173):**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
